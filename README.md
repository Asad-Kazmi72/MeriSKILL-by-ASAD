📊 MeriSKILL Data Analysis Project 2 - Diabetes Data 📊

I'm delighted to share the insights from my recent analysis on a healthcare dataset focused on diagnosing diabetes. Here's a breakdown of what I've been up to:

Project Highlights:

🔍 Descriptive Analysis: Explored the distribution of diabetes cases, summary statistics for key features, and addressed missing data.



📈 Correlation Analysis: Uncovered which features hold the strongest correlations with diabetes, vital for predictive modeling.



📊 Data Visualization: Utilized visualizations to gain insights into data patterns, outliers, and feature distributions.



🧐 Feature Importance: Identified the crucial features for predicting diabetes, paving the way for more accurate models.



🔍 Data Preparation:

- First things first, I separated the features (X) and the target (y) from the dataset.

- Then, I split the data into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing) to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.



⚙️ Model Building: Employed machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM, to predict diabetes. Achieved promising results!



📊 Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using various metrics, ensuring it aligns with healthcare context requirements.



🔄 Cross-Validation: Ensured the model's robustness and generalizability through cross-validation techniques.



🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms:

I experimented with several algorithms to predict diabetes:

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)



📉 Baseline Accuracy:

Before diving into model performance, I calculated the baseline accuracy. Predicting all non-diabetic or all diabetic cases yielded an accuracy of 65%.



📈 Model Performance:

Here's how the models performed in terms of accuracy:

- Logistic Regression: 74%

- Decision Tree: 72%

- Random Forest: 75%

- Support Vector Machine (SVM): 74%



These results are promising, but there's more work to be done!
