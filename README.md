From monthly sales trends to best-sellers and regional variations, this project has been a deep dive into data analytics. 📊


📊 MeriSKILL Data Analysis Project 2 - Diabetes Data 📊

I'm delighted to share the insights from my recent analysis on a healthcare dataset focused on diagnosing diabetes. Here's a breakdown of what I've been up to:

Project Highlights:

🔍 Descriptive Analysis: Explored the distribution of diabetes cases, summary statistics for key features, and addressed missing data.



📈 Correlation Analysis: Uncovered which features hold the strongest correlations with diabetes, vital for predictive modeling.



📊 Data Visualization: Utilized visualizations to gain insights into data patterns, outliers, and feature distributions.



🧐 Feature Importance: Identified the crucial features for predicting diabetes, paving the way for more accurate models.



🔍 Data Preparation:

- First things first, I separated the features (X) and the target (y) from the dataset.

- Then, I split the data into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing) to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.



⚙️ Model Building: Employed machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM, to predict diabetes. Achieved promising results!



📊 Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using various metrics, ensuring it aligns with healthcare context requirements.



🔄 Cross-Validation: Ensured the model's robustness and generalizability through cross-validation techniques.



🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms:

I experimented with several algorithms to predict diabetes:

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)



📉 Baseline Accuracy:

Before diving into model performance, I calculated the baseline accuracy. Predicting all non-diabetic or all diabetic cases yielded an accuracy of 65%.



📈 Model Performance:

Here's how the models performed in terms of accuracy:

- Logistic Regression: 74%

- Decision Tree: 72%

- Random Forest: 75%

- Support Vector Machine (SVM): 74%



These results are promising, but there's more work to be done!



📊 Just completed an insightful data analysis journey as part of my virtual internship with MeriSKILL on an HR Employee Attrition Dataset as Project No. 3!



Here's a snapshot of what I discovered:



🔍 Explored the data to understand its size, missing values, and data types.



🚀 Unveiled key insights into employee attrition:

  - Discovered the overall attrition rate is 16% in the company.

  - Analyzed how gender and marital status impact attrition.

  - Explored age as a factor in attrition.

  - Identified high attrition areas by job roles and departments.



👤 Dived into employee demographics:

  - Examined the age distribution.

  - Uncovered the educational background of employees.

  - Explored gender diversity in the workforce.



😃 Investigated job satisfaction:

  - Explored its connection with attrition.

  - Analyzed job satisfaction variances across job roles.

  - Explored the impact of job involvement on job satisfaction.



💰 Delved into salary and compensation:

  - Examined income distribution.

  - Investigated income variations by job level and department.

  - Analyzed the influence of overtime on monthly income.



🕰️ Explored employee tenure:

  - Calculated the average years at the company.

  - Examined whether longer tenures correlate with lower attrition.

  - Analyzed the relationship between years in the current role and attrition.



🌟 Examined work-life balance and environment satisfaction:

  - Explored their connection with attrition.

  - Analyzed how commute distance affects attrition.



📚 Explored training and development:

  - Investigated the impact of training on attrition.

  - Explored past employment history's influence on attrition.



🚀 Examined promotions and career growth:

  - Analyzed the effect of years since the last promotion.

  - Explored the role of stock options in attrition.



📊 Explored performance and salary hikes:

  - Investigated how performance ratings relate to attrition.

  - Analyzed whether higher salary hikes impact attrition.



🤝 Explored managerial relationships:

  - Investigated the influence of years with the current manager.

  - Analyzed the connection between relationship satisfaction and attrition.



Additionally, performed hypothesis testing and causal inference for specific questions related to the attrition.
